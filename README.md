# Advent of Code Solutions 🎄🧑🏻‍🎄

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles throughout December. Each directory corresponds to a specific year, and within each year, you'll find folders for each day's challenge.

Structure
- Year YYYY:
  - Day XX:
      - solution.py: Python solution code.
      - input.txt: Puzzle input for the day.
Usage
Feel free to explore the solutions and adapt the code as needed. If you have suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Disclaimer
These solutions are provided for educational purposes, and the primary goal is to share knowledge and insights. Keep in mind that the event organizers may update or change puzzle inputs, so these solutions might not be universally applicable to every scenario.

Happy coding and enjoy Advent of Code!
